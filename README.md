# Codeforces Problem Solutions

Welcome to my Codeforces solutions repository!  
This repo is dedicated to improving my logic building and problem-solving skills by tackling a wide variety of Codeforces problems.

## 📚 About

- Contains solutions to Codeforces problems, organized by problem name.
- Written in C++ for efficiency and practice with competitive programming standards.
- Each file typically corresponds to a single problem and includes a self-contained `main` function.

## 🚀 Goals

- Sharpen algorithmic thinking and coding speed.
- Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- Track progress and revisit problems for continuous improvement.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Codeforces.git
   ```
2. Compile any solution using g++:
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall A_Coins.cpp -o A_Coins
   ./A_Coins
   ```
3. Input is usually provided via standard input, as per Codeforces norms.

## 📁 Structure

- Each `.cpp` file is named after the corresponding Codeforces problem.
- Example: `A_Coins.cpp`, `B_Sakurako_and_Water.cpp`, etc.

## ✍️ Notes

- Some files may contain template code for faster contest participation.
- Comments and macros are used for convenience and readability.

## 🏆 Why Codeforces?

Codeforces is one of the most popular platforms for competitive programming, offering a vast range of problems that challenge and enhance problem-solving abilities.
